These binaries for Windows were built using the MinGW cross-compiler
for Linux. The executables were statically linked, so no (additional)
dynamic link libraries (DLLs) are required to run them. They were built
on an x86_64 architecture system, so a 64-bit version of Windows is
required to run them. They were tested on a Windows 10 installation.
