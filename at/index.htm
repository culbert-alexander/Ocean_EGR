    <h1>Which version should I download?</h1>
    There is only one version of the source code; however, you may see
    options for different pre-compiled binaries. If you're using another
    machine or operating systems you'll need to recompile it which
    requires a Fortran95 compiler. The free GFortran compiler works
    well. We have also used the free g95 compiler in the past; however,
    the current version of AT uses get_command_parameter, which is a
    feature of Fortran 2003 not in g95 as of this writing.<br>
    <br>
    <ul style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 9px;">
      <li>
        <p><b>atWinPII_f95</b>. Version for a Windows, Pentium II
          machine.&nbsp; The Makefiles are in a sort of Unix style. If
          you download cygwin (publicly available on the web) you get a
          sort of pseudo-Unix window in which you can just type 'make
          all' and 'make install' to recompile and install.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 18px;"><b>atLinuxPII_f95</b>. Same as
          above but with binaries compiled under Linux.</p>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">atOSXintel</span>. For the
        Mac. Compiled with gfortran. <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    To use the binaries, you will like need gfortran installed (which is
    very easy) since the binaries use dynamic libraries that need to be
    pre-installed.<br>
    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New
        Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span>The Acoustic <span
        class="SpellE">ToolBox</span> includes four acoustic models:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">BELLHOP: A beam/ray
      trace code</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">KRAKEN:<span
        style="">&nbsp; </span>A normal mode code</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>SCOOTER:
      A finite element FFP code</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>SPARC:<span
        style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A time domain FFP code<br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal"><br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>In addition, AT contains BOUNCE,
      which omputes the reflection coefficient for a layered medium and
      may be used to provide input to BELLHOP. A common input structure
      has been used throughout so that only minor modifications are
      needed to switch from one program to another.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New
        Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span>All the models produce `shade'
      files that can be processed using a common set of plotting
      routines to plot transmission loss vs. range or vs. range and
      depth. </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span
        style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
    <h1>Porting the code</h1>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New
        Roman&quot;;"><o:p>Depending on your platform, you may be able
          to execute the pre-compiled binaries. Currently we use
          GFORTRAN to compile those. However, our version requires
          access to gcc dynamic libraries. Therefore, you will need to
          have a compatible version of gcc and gfortran installed on
          your system to run the pre-compiled binaries.<br>
        </o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New
        Roman&quot;;"><o:p>The package adheres strictly to the Fortran
          2003 standard. A few of the Fortran 2003 extensions from
          Fortran 90 are used.<br>
        </o:p></span></p>
    <h2>Record length</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Fortran compilers differ in whether record
      lengths should be declared as bytes or words. To ensure the
      programs run, I declare lengths in bytes. If your compiler uses
      words as the default, look for a compiler switch to override that
      so that your files are not unnecessarily large.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Some of the programs in this package use direct
      access I/O and need to know a record length. Many systems do not
      maintain this information as part of the file info so the code
      writes that information directly into the file. Then the file is
      opened twice. First it is opened with a dummy record length to
      read the actual record length from the file. Then it is re-opened
      with the correct record length. On machines that <i style="">do</i>
      know the correct record length, that first open may generate an
      error message and will have to be removed. The RECL <span
        class="SpellE">specifier</span> should then also be removed from
      the second open.<br>
      <o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
    <h2>Ice Scatter module</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The <span class="SpellE">Twersky</span>-scatter
option










      is problematic because it calls <span class="SpellE">mathieu.f</span>
      and <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">slbessel.f</span></span><span
        class="GramE"> which</span> don't adhere to a rigorous Fortran
      standard. To avoid this problem, the current distribution has this
      option disabled.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">If you want to put it back in, you will need to
      link to <span class="SpellE">twersk.f</span> instead of <span
        class="SpellE">twerskfuse.f</span>. These routines call <span
        class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">mathieu.f</span></span><span
        class="GramE"> which</span> needs to be compiled with a switch
      to initialize all variables to zero. Most compilers have some such
      switch. </p>
    <h2>Plotting:</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Plot packages come and go. However, the output
      formats of the various models are all fairly simple to work with.
      The distribution includes <span class="SpellE">Matlab</span> <span
        class="GramE">scripts which</span> I currently use for plotting.
      If you don’t have <span class="SpellE">Matlab</span>, then these
      will at least provide an example of how to read the file formats.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h1>Installation Notes</h1>
    <p class="MsoNormal">To run the Acoustics Toolbox, the executables
      need to be in your path. The process for setting your path depends
      on your operating system. I can't stay current with the options
      but here are some things that have worked in the past:<br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">DOS: add the
      following to your autoexec.bat to make the scripts executables in
      your default path:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 80px;" class="MsoNormal">SET PATH=%PATH%<span
        class="GramE">;C</span>:\AT\SCRIPTS;C:\AT\BIN<br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">Windows 2000 (and
      perhaps NT): right click on the “My Computer” icon and select
      “Properties”, “advanced”.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">Windows XP: go to
      control panel/Performance and Maintenance/System/Advanced and look
      for the pushbutton <span class="SpellE">labled</span>
      “Environment Variables”. There you can edit the system variable
      “Path”.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p>Obviously these lines
      should be updated to reflect whichever directory you installed
      things in. You may need to reboot to make sure this takes effect.
      Note that the DOS and Unix scripts are not maintained. We
      currently execute the binaries via Matlab.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">If you’re having problems, verify your path
      includes these by typing “path” from a DOS window. Typically you
      run KRAKEN by typing something like “kraken <span class="SpellE">pekeris</span>”.









      at the DOS command line, or kraken( 'pekeris') at the Matlab
      command line. </p>
    <span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">On
      Unix/Linux/MacOSX systems you can ensure that path info is set in
      Matlab at start up by editing .../bin/matlab to add something
      like:</span>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New
        Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source ~/.profile<br>
      </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">where .profile is the shell start up script
      that initializes your path.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Finally, if you use Matlab then you just need
      to use the "Set Path" option under the "File" menu. If you include
      all of the Acoustics Toolbox in your Matlab path, then the Matlab
      scripts find the location of the binaries using the Matlab "which"
      command.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Once you have the basic code working, you might
      want to run some of the test batteries in at/tests to completely
      verify your installation. The m-file, run<span class="SpellE">tests.m</span>
      runs the complete suite of tests<span style="font-family:
        &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> using the Fortran binaries. The
        m-file runtestsM.m does the same thing, using the Matlab
        versions of BELLHOP, SCOOTER, BOUNCE, and SPARC.<br>
      </span></p>
    <span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><br>
      <span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <h1>Updates</h1>
    <p class="MsoNormal">(Check also the individual subdirectories for
      updates on individual components of the Acoustics Toolbox.)</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New
        Roman&quot;;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i style="">December 1997<o:p></o:p></i></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Minor changes have been made to the package for
      improved f77 to f90 portability. Fortran 90 seems to treat
      parameters differently in terms of precision so some of those
      changes are important for the most accurate results.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i style="">July 1999<o:p></o:p></i></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The whole package has been converted to f90/95
      standard with free-format lines and taking advantage of dynamic
      allocation. The code is more concise and portable. Dynamic
      allocation means that you will not have to worry about dimensional
      limits--- the size of the problem you can solve is limited only by
      RAM on your system.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The change to dynamic allocation has forced a
      small change in the input structure. Previously an input format
      was often used with a number of items in a vector followed by the
      actual vector. For instance, the vector of receiver depths is read
      this way.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In the new version the number of items in the
      vector must appear on a separate line so that the code can read
      it, allocate the space, and then read the vector contents.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;">May 2009</span><br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The Matlab version of BELLHOP has been replaced
      by a new version that traces one beam at a time. The ealier
      version traced all the beams in parallel for efficiency; however,
      the logic is too complicated to maintain.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;">December 2009</span><br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Converted most "char foo*5' references, which
      are deprecated in the new Fortran, in favor of "char (len=5) ::
      foo".<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;">January 2010</span><br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Updated the volume attenuation from the 1967
      Thorp formula to the more recent one in JKPS. Converted all the
      Fortran models so that they would determine the file names from
      the command line arguments. This eliminates the need for DOS,
      Unix, or Matlab scripts to move files around.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;">July 2010</span><br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Made all type conversions, e.g. complex to real
      or double to single, explicit. Expanded use of EXPLICIT NONE to
      ensure all variable types are called out. Further expansion of the
      lengths of variable names to take advantage of Fortran 2003.
      Expanded use of structure-variables. Additional changes as
      described in the read.me files for the various models. This is a
      fairly significant revision in terms of the evoloution from
      Fortran 77 to Fortran 2003. However, there are virtually no
      changes to the input and output files.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;">April 2011</span><br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Greatly expanded use of INTENT( IN, OUT,&nbsp;
      etc.) to clarify the source code. Continued changes in variable
      and subroutine names to make them more readable as the Fortran
      2003 standard permits. Use of explicit dimension sizes in variable
      declarations to make it easier for the compiler to detect
      incompatibilities. Change to SHDFile format for the pressure field
      to allow multiple x-y coordinates for the source.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;">October 2011</span><br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Added an option for a source beam pattern in
      KRAKEN and SCOOTER. The pattern is read from a file, following the
      same procedure as in BELLHOP. The beam pattern is actually
      introduced after the KRAKEN or SCOOTER run by processing the mode
      file (FIELD and FIELD3D) or the Green's function file (FIELDS).
      Currently the beam pattern is implemented by shading the
      wavenumber spectrum. As a result the beam pattern must be
      symmetric with respect to the horizontal (only the part of the
      pattern with positive angles is used). This capability has also
      been implemented in the Matlab versions of FIELD and FIELDS;
      however, in FIELD it current only works for the range-independent
      case.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;">March 2012</span><br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The new Matlab changed how it did shell escapes
      (to run things at the command line level) so that piping of stdin
      and stdout no longer worked. To get around this FIELD and FIELDS
      have been modified so that they read from a user specified file
      instead. The field parameter information is now read from
      'root.flp' instead of field.flp, where 'root' is the root of a
      filename passed to the code. This change has been made in both the
      Fortran and Matlab versions. In addition, to make the Matlab more
      compatible with the Fortran version, the various output files
      (SHDFIL.mat, GRNFIL.mat, etc.) now use individually named files
      (root.shd.mat and root.grn.mat, etc.).<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;">February 2013</span><br>
      A bug was fixed in detecting the end of the SSP for a given layer.
      Instead of testing for exact equality of the SSP depth to the
      bottom-depth of the layer, I had previously checked for agreement
      to within a tolerance. The tolerance was scaled based on the
      bottom depth of the layer so for a bottom depth of zero (in an
      aeroacoustic problem) the tolerance was 0 and the bottom was not
      detected.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;">February 2014</span><br>
      Checks have been added to ensure certain vectors are monotonically
      increasing where that assumption is critical to the codes.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;">November 2014</span><br>
      The Matlab routines that read altimetry and bathymetry files were
      not clearing old data on subsequent calls. This occured only when
      the flat boundary was selected and the routines were supposed to
      return dummy boundary information. Also, the ranges were not being
      converted to meters from kilometers. It effected SimplePE runs and
      probably the Matlab version of BELLHOP as well. These routines are
      not used by any of the Fortran implementations and the error often
      had no effect on the Matlab codes.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i>June 2014</i><br>
      Sometime around January of 2010 the Thorpe formula for volume
      attenuation was modified at the request of a user. The modified
      formula was slightly more accurate. The change was verified in
      BELLHOP; however, there an incorrect variable name was used in the
      crci routine used by KRAKEN and SCOOTER. That error mean the added
      Thorpe attenuation was never added. This is corrected in the new
      code. The volume attenuation was typically most important for
      higher frequency sources, which in turn were more often treated in
      BELLHOP. However, the error can be important for low frequency
      sources at very long range.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i>July 2017</i><br>
      The package has been modified to allow broadband runs for most of
      the models. Thus, for example, you can give a vector of
      frequencies to KRAKEN or SCOOTER and produce a single pressure
      file containing results for each of the frequencies. This has
      required a small change to the file formats for modfils, shdfils,
      grndfils, etc. In addition, all the Matlab codes have been
      modified to allow the '/' convention used in the Fortran versions.
      This option allows a user to either specify a full vector or just
      specify the upper and lower limits terminated by '/'. It then uses
      those limits to create a vector of equally spaced points.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i>November 2017</i><br>
      Updates and fixes to the noise routines in at/Matlab/noise. A
      routine has been added to construct the noise covariance matrix
      directly from the shdfil. The shdfil contains the complex pressure
      field vs. range and depth and the noise routine can use such files
      produced by KRAKEN, KRAKENC, SCOOTER, and BELLHOP.<br>
    </p>
