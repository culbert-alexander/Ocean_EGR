2d folder - contains files (and utility fxns) to read .wav audio files and their corresponding bathymetry's, train neural network, and do 2d reconstruction with output of net

input_output.m: reads .wav audio files and their corresponding bathymetry and creates input and output for neural net
nnet.m: contains neural network architecture and runs training algorithm
net1main.m: reconstructs bathymetry from output of neural net

3d folder - contains files (and utility fxns) to read .wav audio files and their corresponding bathymetry's, train neural network, and do 3d reconstruction with output of net

input_output_3d.m: for 3d, reads .wav audio files and their corresponding bathymetry and creates input and output for neural net
input_output_3d_multipings.m: for 3d multipings, reads .wav audio files and their corresponding bathymetry and creates input and output for neural net
nnet3d.m: contains neural network architecture and runs training algorith
result.m: reconstructs 3d bathymetry from output of neural net

Future plans: add convolution layers, use auto encoders
